          <p id="fact">An interesting fact about tigers is that they are excellent swimmers and enjoy spending time in water . 
            Tigers have been observed swimming distances of up to several kilometers, making them one of the most proficient swimmers among land animals. "Tigers are often looked as being one of the most beautiful yet ferocious animals and perhaps this is a sole driving factor that makes them even more interesting creatures. But sadly, they have come to a verge of being categorized as endangered, thanks to the human sloppiness and prudence. As a wildlife lover with keen interest on large cats, I enjoy visiting wildlife sanctuaries but the question remains, how well do I or we know about this exotic animal? We’re often clouded by many misconceptions with other large cat species, but hopefully, you’ll learn something about them through this blog where I’ve listed some facts about tigers. Spoiler alert - you would be knowing some of the facts already but what the hell!"

            <li class="labels"><h3>Tigers can sprint at over 60 kilometre/hour: </h3>
              <img class="sprint" src="/images/sprint.png">
              <p>Not the fastest runner in the animal kingdom but the fact that Tigers have very strong legs makes them sprint more or less than 60 kilometres per hour, but it is only possible for short distances.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="labels"><h3>Tigers live for about 25 years: </h3>
              <img src="/images/tigers-live.png">
              <p>The life expectancy of Tigers is between 20-25 years whether they are kept in captivity or in the wild. However, most die before the age of 20, like for instance, the death of a nineteen-year-old Machli in Ranthambore National Park, Rajasthan, India. The oldest living Tiger so far was 25-year-old Flavel, a circus-rescued, sheltered in a zoo in Tampa, Florida.</p>

            <li class="labels"><h3>Tigers are the largest amongst other wild cats: </h3>
              <img src="/images/largest.png">
              <p>You probably knew this that Royal Bengal Tigers are the largest amongst other wild cats but did you also know that the male Tigers weigh up to 300 kilograms. Jezz! That’s like weighing a group of six average human. All they have to do is sit on top of you licking their paws, you’d be dead instantly.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="labels"><h3>Tigers have diverse diet: </h3>
              <img src="/images/diverse.png">
              <p>The Tigers have a varied diet and can feast on anything that comes its way, be it, a wild boar, deer/antelope, rodent, bear, bird, rhino, crocodile, buffalo and even their own group of cats like leopards. They even eat fish!</p>

          <p id="info">This unique ability allows tigers to inhabit a wide range of habitats, including forests, grasslands, and wetlands, and makes them formidable predators in their natural environment.</p>
          <h2>Where do we stand today in safeguarding Tigers?</h2>
          <p>Tigers are one of the most beautiful animals in the world, no wonder it is considered the national animal of India. Its black and orange stripes put these solitary animals apart from the rest of the species. Just for the record, India has around 70 percent of the tiger population in the whole world (standing ovation please). Slowly but gradually, we can see a remarkable difference in wildlife ever since killing and selling of tigers skin was banned. In fact, back in 2016, World Wildlife Fund (WWF) declared the tiger population in India to have risen dramatically. Today, amongst the eight, we are surrounded by only five subspecies of tigers like Siberian, Sumatran, the Great Bengal, South China and Indochinese; the extinct three species are Javan, Bali, and Caspian.</p>
            
            <h2>How can we start to save the Wildlife and Tigers?</h2>
            <p>What an individual can do to protect the tigers is perhaps by spreading the word, the Tigers are constantly under threat due to copious infrastructures. Although there have been restrictions in certain areas that are dedicated to wildlife, there have been constant reports on tigers wandering in the rural villages. One can always be a responsible tourist by maintaining silence and not disturbing the animals. And also, try to reduce using natural resources from forests like paper and help in forest conservation. Phew! So much to learn and so much to talk about animal rights but if you keep reading our blogs, we’ll make sure you get more interesting wildlife topics to read about.</p>
